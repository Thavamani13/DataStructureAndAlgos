	/*
	 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
	 * Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If
	 * the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
	 * 
	 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
	 * 
	 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
	 * 
	 * Example 1:
	 * 
	 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 2 Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your
	 * function should return the index number 2. Example 2:
	 * 
	 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Your function can return
	 * either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where
	 * the peak element is 6.

	/**
	 * 1) Did I understand the problem? Yes or No !! -> If No, Ask the person to
	 * provide more detail with example(s) -> If yes, go to next step !!
	 * 
	 * What is the input(s)?int[] intarr , What is the expected output? int a Do I
	 * have constraints to solve the problem?
	 * 
	 * Solve it using O(log n) time.
	 * 
	 * Do I have all informations to go to next step!! How big is your test data set
	 * will be?
	 * 
	 * 2) Test data set
	 * 
	 * Minimum of 3 data set !! Positive, Edge, Negative Validate with the
	 * interviewer if the data set is fine by his/her assumptions Positive :Peak
	 * element occurs Negative : no peak element Edge : Duplicate elements
	 * 
	 * 3) Do I know how to solve it?
	 * 
	 * Yes - great, is there an alternate? No - Can I break down the problem into
	 * sub problems?
	 * 
	 * 4) Ask for hint (If you do not know how to solve)
	 * 
	 * 5) Do I know alternate solutions as well?
	 * 
	 * Yes - What are those? No - That is still fine, proceed to solve by what you
	 * know !!
	 * 
	 * 6) If you know alternate solutions -> find out the O Notations (Performance)
	 * 
	 * Then, explain either both or the best (depends on the time)
	 * 
	 * Approach 1: Start with worst -> Improve (Optimize) -> End up with the best
	 * Approach 2: Write down the options and benefits and code the best
	 * 
	 * 7) Start always with Psuedo code
	 * 
	 * 8) Implement them in the code (editor)
	 * 
	 * 9) Test against the different data set
	 * 
	 * 10) If it fails, debug them to solve it !! /
